### abstracts_2_vec_per_author
In this notebook, we embed the abstract of the papers into a low dimensional space (using either sentencetransformers library or doc2vec from Gensim) and associate to each author his abstracts embedding
### generate_data
Create Train / Dev / Test files. <br> Each file is a dictionary where each key represent the ID of a certain Author and each value is a dict where the keys are : <br> - author_embedding : the Node embedding that correspond to the author (tensor of shape (128,)) <br> - papers_embedding : the abstract embedding of every papers (tensor of shape (10,dim)) (dim depend on the embedding model taken into account) <br> - features : the graph structural features (tensor of shape (4,)) <br> - y : the target (tensor of shape (1,))
### generate_node2vec
As it is written in the title, in this notebook we generate embedding for each node by training a Node2Vec model. <br> Source : [Nodevectors Github](https://github.com/VHRanger/nodevectors)
### preprocess_abstract
This notebook is made in order to process the abstract. <br>
The format of the text in the abstract is not suited for being processed by models (doc2vec, bert etc ...)

## src
Contains the main code for training/inference

# Training and Inference
Training_notebook is made for training, it will generate 10 model checkpoint. \
inference_training is made for inference, it will generate three submissions : \
- ensemble_model_ST.csv (predictions using the text embedding by SentenceTransformers)
- ensemble_model_d2v.csv (predictions using the text embedding by Doc2Vec)
- ensemble_model.csv (mean predictions of both ST & D2V) => This is the one that scored 3.46 on the public set and 3.50 on the private set.


Final rank : 8th
